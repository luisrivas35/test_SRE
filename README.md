# test_SRE files
- 3 folders, one AWS exercise with a main.tf file, the second one with code for GCP deployment 
and the last one with code for ansible deployment on the GCP nodes
- 1 PDF file with requirements for the test
- word document for some pics
- The correct sequence provisioning the cluster with Ansible is: install-kube.yml, master.yml, nodes.yml
